I need to create a working POC web page that opens a camera, scans a barcode and prefills input filled with the scanned value. 

Choose an appropriate NPM package for that for both IOS and Android, and build a full solution. Make sure to test that everything runs, compiles and scans. Do not stop building and checking unless actually works.

Thanks!
